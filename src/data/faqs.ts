  ["What exactly is NGR Fixed 5%?",
    "Earn a fixed return of 5% in anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks."
  ],
  [
    "Will there be a private sale?  Presale?  Owner allocation?",
    "No, no, and no.  It was fair launched."
  ],
  [
    "Why is the max investment only $25?",
    "NGR 5% fixed is our “small investor” option.  This allows small investors to earn a fair rate of return for a limited risk of 8%.  Please consider NGR Drip for larger investments."
  ],
  [
    "Why is GROW token used?",
    "GROW utilizes Internal Liquidity Pool technology via a Swapper contract, which does not require PancakeSwap. It rises in value whether it's bought OR sold, and is over 100% collateralized by USDT at all times.  Further, while buys raise value in a linear fashion, selling raises the value exponentially.  If NGR is the car, GROW token is the engine."
  ],
  [
    "Is this a Ponzi?",
    "NO!  A Ponzi scam commits to paying out more than actually exists in total funds.  That is NOT the case here.  Each investment is fully collateralized by USDT.  Either the investor leaves with a 5% profit, or the investor exits early at an 8% loss."
  ],
  [
    "Is this a fancy miner?",
    "NO!  There is no “communal pot” and no “miner algorithm”.  Your holdings are YOUR holdings.    "
  ],
  [
    "Will you be using the TCV for trading to generate additional revenue?",
    "Absolutely NOT.  The TCV is locked forever and can't be tampered with."
  ],
  [
    "Am I limited to $25?",
    "Per investment, yes.  The minimum is $10 and the maximum will be $25.  Keep in mind that each wallet can have as many individual investments as desired.  There is no cap to the total dollars any one investor can deposit."
  ],
  [
    "How do I invest?",
    "Easy!  Simply make a deposit via our dApp."
  ],
  [
    "Can I buy GROW outside of NGR?",
    "No.  GROW only exists within NGR and it is not possible to purchase any other way."
  ],
  [
    "What is the Liquidation Price (LP)?",
    "The LP shows the price at which GROW must appreciate to trigger your own personal liquidation events."
  ],
  [
    "What is a Liquidation Event (LE)?",
    "A LE is when a profit target is met and the investment moves to the queue to be liquidated by a verified liquidator."
  ],
  [
    "When my LEs are triggered, do the actual TXs happen automatically?",
    "No.  Liquidations are executed by verified liquidators."
  ],
  [
    "Can anyone be a liquidator and claim the rewards?",
    "No.  As of launch, an investor must have invested a minimum of $50 total into NGR to qualify as a liquidator.  That threshold is likely to go up over time."
  ],
  [
    "How long will I have to wait to receive my investment plus profit back?",
    "Time frames can vary, but generally each investment can last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks."
  ],
  [
    "Can the TCV ever be drained?",
    "No, it is not possible to drain the TCV.  Every investment is fully collateralized."
  ],
  [
    "I just invested $15 in NGR 5%.  I want to add to my position.  Can I do that?",
    "You cannot add to an existing investment, but you CAN make as many NEW deposits as you would like.  The dApp will lay out each investment separately for you, showing the Liquidation Price for each."
  ],
  [
    "Is there a penalty for withdrawing before the LE events are triggered?",
    "The investor will lose the full tax amount of 8% if exiting before their LE."
  ],
  [
    "What are the taxes for?",
    "The 5% return option has a 4% buy and 4% sell tax, for a total of 8%. 6% raises the price of GROW, 2% goes to the co-founders for development and marketing. "
  ],
  [
    "What is the Lottery?",
    "The Lottery will be an add-on service.  For a very small ticket price, investors will have a chance to win cash prizes. "

export const dripF: Array<[string, string]> = [
[
  "What is NGR Drip?",
"Drip returns a daily ROI up to .5%/day (after taxes)."
],

[
  "What is the investment minimum and maximum?",
"Minimum is $100 USDT.  There is no maximum."
],

[
  "How does it work?",
"Each investor will physically own the GROW tokens that will comprise their drips.  Because GROW rises in price after every TX, buy or sell, your Drips will grow in value every time it's traded."
],

[
  "Is NGR Drip a miner?",
"NO!  There is no miner algorithm associated with Drip.  Each investor's holdings are entirely their own."
],

[
  "Why is the return “up to” .5%/day, and not a flat .5%/day?",
"Each Drip accumulates over a day, maxing out at the 24-hour mark.  The accumulated Drip can be claimed anywhere in that 24-hour window."
],

[
  "Do I have to make a claim every 24 hours?  Can I let it build over days or weeks?",
"No.  GROW rises in price each time it's transacted.  The more it's traded, the faster it rises.  That's why each investor is required to claim once every 24 hours."
],

[
  "What if I miss my claim and 24 hours passes?",
"Don't panic, you didn't lose your payout.  Your claim will be moved to the “liquidators” page to be executed by a liquidator.  If your claim is moved to the liquidator page, you will forego .1% profit to pay the liquidator."
],

[
  "Can I claim after 12 hours?  Does it have to be 24 hours?",
"Claims can be made at any time, once per 24 hours.  If you make a claim after 12 hours, the 24-hour clock begins anew."
],

[
  "How do I become a liquidator?",
"Each investor in NGR Drip will be eligible to liquidate his/her fellow investors on claims that are greater than 24 hours old."
],

[
  "Can I quit or are my funds locked?",
"We don't believe in locking funds.  Your money should be accessible whenever you want it.  If an investor exits early before their entire GROW holdings are dripped out, there is a small 10% penalty on any GROW left over."
],

[
  "What are the taxes?",
"Taxes in are 15%.  Drips are paid in AFTER tax dollars, so payments will always be net."
],

[
  "How is NGR Drip not a Ponzi?  I thought all drips were Ponzi schemes.",
"Just like our 5% fixed option, NGR Drip is fully collateralized.  Your tokens belong to you.  There is no shared pot and no miner algorithm.  We don't promise to pay out more than exists in the contract."
],

[
  "How much can I earn?",
"Given the collateralization and the fact that GROW will rise every TX, NGR Drip can return anywhere between 50% profit to 5X or more.  "
],

[
  "I've invested $1,000 in NGR Drip.  Can I add to my position?",
"Any investor at any time can always add to their position, and that will adjust their Drip accordingly. The minimum is $100, and there will be a $10 minimum after that if investors want to add to their positions.  In addition, all investments must be integers.  For example, one can invest $125, but they cannot invest $125.50."

export const minerF: Array<[string, string]> = [
  ["What makes NGR Miner different from other miners?",
"NGR Miner uses GROW token as its currency.  Because GROW is an appreciating stablecoin, Miner holdings can ascend very quickly.  Risk is also hedged to the downside."],

["What does the Miner pay?",
"Up to 3% per day."],

["Can the NGR Miner negatively impact Fixed and Drips investors?",
"Absolutely NOT.  Any investment in NGR Miner can only help Fixed and Drips investors."],

["Must an investor be invested in Fixed or Drips in order to participate?",
"No.  Originally being a Fixed or Drips investor was supposed to be a prerequisite for the Miner, but after further thought the team felt that anyone should be able to invest in the Miner, keeping in mind that transactions will only help Fixed and Drips investors."],

["How do Drips and Fixed investors benefit exactly from the Miner?",
"The Miner will have its own pool, just like Fixed is a pool, just like Drips is a pool.  Every time an investor interacts with the Miner contract, GROW’s price will rise.  Although the Miner pool may go up and down in TCV depending on communal actions, those in Fixed and Drips will only benefit because the overall price of GROW will rise every time it’s traded."],

["What else is unique about NGR Miner?",
"Every investor must take an action at least once every 24 hours.  Most will compound way more than that, but once per day is the minimum.  If an investor fails to take an action (compound / redeem), the contents of the pending claim will be force liquidated. This is a GOOD thing.  Inactive investors cause GROW price stagnation, so by force liquidating inactive investors we ensure constant price appreciation."],

["Is the NGR Miner just a fork of Binance Wealth Matrix?",
"No.  Other than both projects mining an appreciating stablecoin, NGR Miner functions nothing like BWM.  BWM was poorly thought out and poorly executed.  We've optimized NGR Miner in almost every way possible in order to maximize profits and minimize risk."],
